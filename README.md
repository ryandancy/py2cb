# Py2CB

An MCEdit script to convert python scripts to command block sequences. Tested
with Minecraft 1.8 and MCEdit 1.2.5.0.

Examples are found in `examples/`. For example, the `roman_numerals.py` script
generates a command-block chain which outputs sequential Roman numerals.

Depends on (`pynbt`)[https://github.com/TkTech/PyNBT].
